Notes on installing opencv:

Homebrew seems to be the easy way 
on mavericks I had to use 2.4.7.1

clone [homebrew-science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues/402)
and searching the repo for the commit at that version then changing `opencv.rb` 

Might have to download the zip seperatly and rename it.

It will complain about the sha mismatch
